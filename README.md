### A ChromeOS daemon to enable sudo in crosh shell.
<br>

## How to install:


- Requires developer mode. 

- Press `ctrl-alt-t` to open crosh, type `shell`, and paste:

<pre>bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowed1/Sucrose/main/bin/sucrose_downloader.sh?$(date +%s)")</pre>

<br>

## How to use:

- After installing, open VT-2 (ctrl-alt-refresh), log in as chronos, and run:
`sudo sucrose-daemon` and let it run. 

- Leave VT-2 (ctrl-alt-back) and sudo should now be enabled in crosh shell!
- After rebooting or exiting the daemon, run `sudo sucrose-daemon` in VT-2 logged in as chronos to re-enable.

### *Starting the daemon in VT-2, testing sudo, and then closing the daemon in VT-2 with ctrl-c:*

### How does this work? 

- Uses `mkfifo` for bidirectional communication between crosh shell and VT-2 when running the daemon.
- The daemon uses `read` to wait for use of its fifo before it replies back to the sucrose wrapper.
- Sucrose wrapper checks for daemon's fifo to detect if it is running or not.
- Daemon can only recieve data if `sudo` or `sucrose` command is prepended to user's argument.
- Fully atomic and ephemeral without any buffer; stdout goes directly to TTY.
- Dynamically creates/removes sudo alias by checking if no new privileges flag is set. 

<br>

### How to remove:
- Enter VT-2, log in as chronos, and run `sudo sucrose_uninstaller` to uninstall.

*Why make this tool if we can enable sudo natively?*

- This tool does not require rootfs verification disabled and makes fewer changes to our chromebooks out of the box.
- Recommended for newer ChromeOS/Linux developer mode users or for users just wanting sudo enabled ASAP.
- No dependencies needed.
